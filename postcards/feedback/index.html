	<title>Brandon's Feedback for Hanna</title>

	<h1> Hi Hanna! </h1>

	<h2> Aesthetic </h2>

	<p> The overall aesthetic seems consistent and gives the nostalgic feeling of the show.  The design choices of image and text support each other well. </p>

	<p> I think the most effective sheet for legibility is Joey's quote.  You did a nice job of placing the white text on a solid dark red background (placement technique), which makes the text easy to read.  Ross and Phoebe's quotes are over busier sections of the images, which make them a bit more difficult to read.  I would consider changing the placement of the text or the treatment of the background.  Maybe with Phoebe's you could have a gradient with the darker part at the bottom so we can see her face and then the text will also be emphasized?

	<p> Also, in Phoebe's mobile image, I think you have a default "text" box that shows up in Photoshop.  Easy fix! <p> 

	<p> With Phoebe's web image, is the TNT HD logo intentional? I would either have it for all of them as a reference or none of them to unify the aesthetic. </p>

	<p> I think the treatment of the typeface is good.  I might consider giving the name of the speaker a little room to breathe below the quote.  It seems like it is infringing on the space of the quote. </p>

	<h2> Structure </h2>

	<p> I consider the picture to be background and the text to be foreground, which makes sense.  Since the images are from television sets, they are a little busy.  I would take another look and make sure that the text is not competing with the image that it is over, especially in Ross and Pheobe's quotes. </p>

	<h2> Technical Challenges </h2>

	<p> This seems like it should be pretty manageable to build.  I think that some of the images look a little fuzzy.  I'm not sure if this is a function of the quality of the image or of the treatment of the image, but I would look into seeing if you can make them a little sharper. </p>

	<p> I would take another look at Ross's mobile image and see if you can work with the left edge.  It looks like it is about to cut off his eye, and I worry about how this may transfer to certain mobile devices.  I would see if you can give it a bit more room </p>

	<h2> Overall, good work! These were fun to take a look at! </h2>

	<h3> Thanks, <br> Brandon </h3>
