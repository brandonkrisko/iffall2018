	1. Need to design for scrolling, rather than fitting it all on one page.  The text may be too small on a phone right now. <br> <br> 

	2. If you want to refer to ingredients, make a hover link to see the amount of the ingredient necessary.  This will be a more efficient use of space than keeping the ingredients on the page the entire time. <br> <br> 

	3. Present the steps and ingredients in horizontal color blocks. <br> <br>
