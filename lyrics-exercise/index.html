		<h2 class="head"> From the Broadway Musical <em>"Dear Evan Hansen"</em>
		<h3> Written by Pasek and Paul, originally performed by Ben Platt</h3>

		<h2> Verse 1 </h2>
			<p> I've learned to slam on the brake <br>
			before I even turn the key <br>
			before I make the mistake <br>
			before I lead with the worst of me. <br>
			Give them no reason to stare <br>
			No slipping up if you slip away <br>
			So I've got nothing to share <br>
			No I've got nothing to say <br> </p>

		<p> <h2> Pre-Chorus </h2>
			Step out, step out of the sun, <br>
			If you keep getting burned. <br>
			Step out, step out of the sun, <br>
			Because you've learned, because you've learned </p>

		<h2> Chorus </h2>
			<p> On the oustide always looking in, <br>
				Will I ever be more than I've always been? <br>
				'Cause I'm tap, tap, tappin' on the glass, <br>
				Wavin' through a window. <br>

				I try to speak but nobody can hear, <br>
				So I wait around for an answer to appear <br>
				While I'm watch, watch, watching people pass, <br>
				Wavin' through a window. <br>

				Can anybody see? Is anybody waving back at me? </p>

		<h2> Verse 2 </h2>
			<p> We start with stars in our eyes, <br>
				We start believing that we belong, <br>
				But every sun doesn't rise, <br>
				And no one tells you where you went wrong. <br>

		<h2> <em>(repeat pre-chorus and chorus)</em>

		<h2> Bridge </h2>
			<p> When you're fallen in a forest, <br>
				And there's nobody around <br>
				Do you ever really crash, or even make a sound? (x4) <p>

		<h2> <em> (repeat chorus) </em> </h2>

		<h2> Coda </h2>
			<p> Is anybody waving? Waving? Waving? Woah, woah. </p>
